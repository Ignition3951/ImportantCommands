Installation link for kafka:
	https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-apache-kafka-on-ubuntu-22-04/#:~:text=This%20tutorial%20provides%20you%20with%20step-by-step%20instructions%20to,account%20access%20to%20the%20Ubuntu%2022.04%20Linux%20system.

First install java in ubuntu lts server:
	https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-java-on-ubuntu-22-04/

change the wget in the above link from:
	wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.deb
to:
	wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.12_linux-x64_bin.deb

If you have installed multiple Java versions on a single system, go to the next step to change the default Java version with update-alternatives CLI on a Ubuntu system:
	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-17/bin/java 100

Download kafka:
	wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/4.0.0/kafka_2.13-4.0.0.tgz --> (this process is not working)

Alternate approach link: (after the jvm installation as it was successful)
	(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-kafka-on-ubuntu-20-04)

	sudo adduser kafka--> (Password is : Password)
	sudo adduser kafka sudo
	mkdir ~/Downloads
	curl "https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/4.0.0/kafka_2.13-4.0.0.tgz" -o ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz --> 
	curl "https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.2/kafka_2.13-2.8.2.tgz" -o ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz --> (changing the link to this worked https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.2/kafka_2.13-2.8.2.tgz)
	mkdir ~/kafka && cd ~/kafka
	tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz --strip 1  --> (You specify the --strip 1 flag to ensure that the archiveâ€™s contents are extracted in ~/kafka/ itself and not in another directory (such as ~/kafka/kafka_2.13-2.8.2/) inside of it.)
	nano ~/kafka/config/server.properties (paste the value [delete.topic.enable = true] and logs path as well)
	nano /etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service (Copy the data provided on the site)
	nano /etc/systemd/system/kafka.service (Copy the data provided on the site)
	sudo systemctl start kafka --> to start kafka
	sudo systemctl status kafka --> to check status of kafka

To check the messages in the topic :
	./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic multiType --from-beginning --max-messages 10 	-- > (the path in the server is home/kafka/kafka/bin) --> in server or VM the path is usr/bin and command starts 	from kafka-console-consumer

Erros faced while using kafka on 26th May:
	InconsistentClusterId Exception was occuring and the server was closing:
	Resolution : There was  a file in /home/kafka/logs called meta.properties which was moved to bkp file and the issue was resolved
