Steps to connect on ssh:
https://www.golinuxcloud.com/ssh-into-virtualbox-vm/: 
	ss -ntlp | grep -i ssh --> to check which port is being used by ssh
	## Check if UFW is active
	sudo ufw status

	## If the above command returns 'inactive', enable UFW using:
	sudo ufw enable

	## Allow SSH service (port 22)
	sudo ufw allow ssh

	## Reload UFW rules (if needed)
	sudo ufw reload

Steps to allow to connect to mysql server running on server:

	ufw status--> to check the status
	To make port 3306 allowed use:

	ufw allow 3306--> to open the port for connection

Find the file by name:
	find –name “kafka_2.13-4.0.0.tgz”
	find –iname “kafka\*”
	find / -type d -name 'docker' -->(the first parameter "/" is where to look, in this case "/" it's the entire 						system.
						-name could be -iname to ignore case
						also -type is not mandatory. Directories will not be listed because we're specifically telling it to look for files 						only, with -type f.)


If you want to put the local files in the server:
	scp -P 22 SpringDockerExample-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar utk131189@192.168.1.112:/tmp
