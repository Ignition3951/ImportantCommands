To see whether the nginx is running in windows:
	tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"

Run nginx.exe with different configuration file:
	nginx.exe -c confv1/nginx.conf -- > (run the command in the following folder structure <C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe>)
OR
	nginx.exe -p . -c conf/nginx.conf --> 

NOTE: We have used open-resty as it integrates nginx with lua language and the path is <C:\openresty-1.27.1.2-win64>
